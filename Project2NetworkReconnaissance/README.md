## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic network reconnaissance using Nmap to identify open ports and services. Port 631/tcp (IPP printing service) was identified as open. If exposed externally, this service could be targeted for reconnaissance or unauthorized access attempts. Risk can be reduced by restricting network access through firewall rules.

## Objective
Understand exposed services on a system and assess potential attack surfaces.

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Linux Mint
